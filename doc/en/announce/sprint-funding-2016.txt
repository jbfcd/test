call for (funding of) the next pytest-sprint
======================================================

The pytest core group is looking for donations or invoiced
money from companies and individuals in order to fund travels
and accomodation for the next pytest sprint, June 20-26th 2016
in Freiburg, Germany.  If this works out you can expect some
great new developments in the python testing space to be released
in 2016.  Here is a short list of preliminary topics:

- improving pytest-xdist test scheduling to take into account
  fixture setups and explicit user hints.

- provide info on fixture dependencies during --collect-only

- tying pytest-xdist to tox so that you can do "py.test -e py34"
  to run tests in a particular tox-managed virtualenv.  Also
  look into making pytest-xdist use tox environments on
  remote ssh-sides so that remote dependency management becomes
  easier.

- refactoring the fixture system so more people understand it :)

- integrating PyUnit setup methods as autouse fixtures.
  possibly adding ways to influence ordering of same-scoped
  fixtures (so you can make a choice of which fixtures come
  before others)

- fixing bugs and issues from the tracker (endless source :)

The sprint is going to take place for several days with a break
day in between in the black forest town Freiburg in Germany.

Here are some participants who said they could likely come,
given some funding::

    Andreas Pelme, Sweden
    Brianna Laughner, Australia
    Bruno Oliveira, Brazil
    Florian Bruhin, Switzerland
    Florian Bruynooghe, UK
    Holger Krekel, Germany
    Omar Kohl, Germany
    Raphael Pierzina, US/UK

Other contributors and newcomers are invited to join as well but please
send a mail to the pytest-dev mailing list if you intend to do so
somewhat soon.  If you are working for a company and using pytest heavily
you are welcome to join and we also encourage your company to provide
some funding for the sprint.  They may see it, and rightfully so, as a
very cheap training which brings you together with the experts in the
field :)

The money we need to the travels and accommodation is estimated to
be around 6000 Euro currently.  If you are a company and paying is easier
for you to process via an invoice, Holger's company http://merlinux.eu can
invoice you for the sprint and will channel the funds to the
participants.
