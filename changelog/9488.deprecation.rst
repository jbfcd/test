If custom subclasses of nodes like :class:`pytest.Item` override the
``__init__`` method, they should take ``**kwargs``. See
:ref:`uncooperative-constructors-deprecated` for details.

Note that a deprection warning is only emitted when there is a conflict in the
arguments pytest expected to pass. This deprecation was already part of pytest
7.0.0rc1 but wasn't documented.
