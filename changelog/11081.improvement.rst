The :confval:`norecursedir` check is now performed in a :hook:`pytest_ignore_collect` implementation, so plugins can affect it.

If after updating to this version you see that your `norecursedir` setting is not being respected,
it means that a conftest or a plugin you use has a bad `pytest_ignore_collect` implementation.
Most likely, your hook returns `False` for paths it does not want to ignore,
which ends the processing and doesn't allow other plugins, including pytest itself, to ignore the path.
The fix is to return `None` instead of `False` for paths your hook doesn't want to ignore.
