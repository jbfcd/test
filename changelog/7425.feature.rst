New :fixture:`test_path` fixture, which is identical to :fixture:`testdir` but its methods return :class:`pathlib.Path` when appropriate instead of ``py.path.local``.

This is part of the movement to use :class:`pathlib.Path` objects internally, in order to remove the dependency to ``py`` in the future.
