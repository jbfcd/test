Added :confval:`tmp_path_retention_count` and :confval:`tmp_path_retention_policy` configuration options to control how directories created by the :fixture:`tmp_path` fixture are kept.
The default behavior has changed to keep only directories for failed tests, equivalent to `tmp_path_retention_policy="failed"`.
