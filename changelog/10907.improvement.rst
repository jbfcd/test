When an exception traceback to be displayed is completely filtered out (by mechanisms such as ``__tracebackhide__``, internal frames, and similar), now only the exception string and the following message are shown:

"All traceback entries are hidden. Pass `--full-trace` to see hidden and internal frames.".

Previously, the last frame of the traceback was shown, even though it was hidden.
