`Parser.addoption` now throws a value error if an attempt is made at adding an option
after the pre_parsing process without including a default. If the user decides to
provides a default a warning will be given since the option will not be available
for use in the command line.

This occurs if conftest files aren't in the root directory or any sub directory
matching the `test*` regex. conftest files which match the previous statement
will have their options added after the configuration and parsing phase.
