Option ``--no-print-logs`` is deprecated and meant to be removed in a future release. If you use ``--no-print-logs``, please try out ``--show-capture`` and
provide feedback.

``--show-capture`` command-line option was added in ``pytest 3.5.0`` and allows to specify how to
display captured output when tests fail: ``no``, ``stdout``, ``stderr``, ``log`` or ``all`` (the default).
