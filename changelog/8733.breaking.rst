Drop a workaround for `pyreadline <https://github.com/pyreadline/pyreadline>`__ that made it work with ``--pdb``.

The workaround was introduced in `#1281 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/1281>`__ in 2015, however since then
`pyreadline seems to have gone unmaintained <https://github.com/pyreadline/pyreadline/issues/58>`__, is `generating
warnings <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8847>`__, and will stop working on Python 3.10.
