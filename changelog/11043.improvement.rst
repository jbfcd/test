When `--confcutdir` is not specified, and there is no config file present, the conftest cutoff directory (`--confcutdir`) is now set to the :ref:`rootdir`.
Previously in such cases, `conftest.py` files would be probed all the way to the root directory of the filesystem.
If you are badly affected by this change, consider adding an empty config file to your desired cutoff directory, or explicitly set `--confcutdir`.
