pytest now supports ``pyproject.toml`` files for configuration.

The configuration options is similar to the one available in other formats, but must be defined
in a ``[tool.pytest.ini_options]`` table to be picked up by pytest:

.. code-block:: toml

    # pyproject.toml
    [tool.pytest.ini_options]
    minversion = "6.0"
    addopts = "-ra -q"
    testpaths = [
        "tests",
        "integration",
    ]

More information can be found `in the docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/customize.html#configuration-file-formats>`__.
