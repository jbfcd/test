The functionality for running tests written for ``nose`` has been officially deprecated.

This includes:

* Plain ``setup`` and ``teardown`` functions and methods: this might catch users by surprise, as ``setup()`` and ``teardown()`` are not pytest idioms, but part of the ``nose`` support.
* Setup/teardown using the `@with_setup <with-setup-nose>`_ decorator.

For more details, consult the :ref:`deprecation docs <nose-deprecation>`.
