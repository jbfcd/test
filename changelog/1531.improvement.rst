Improved the very verbose diff for every standard library container types. Previously,
this would use the default python pretty printer, which puts opening and closing
markers on the same line as the first/last entry, in addition to not having
consistent indentation.

The indentation is now consistent and the markers on their own separate lines
which should reduce the diffs shown to users.
