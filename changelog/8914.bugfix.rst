If fixtures had been indirectly parameterized via test function, e.g. using the
``@pytest.mark.parametrize(indirect=True)`` marker, reordering of tests for the least possible fixture setup/teardown
cycles did not work. Optimized test groups can now be determined either explicitly by passing parameter ids, or
implicitly if the parameter value is hashable.
