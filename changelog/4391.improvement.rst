Improved precision of test durations measurement. ``CallInfo`` items now have a new ``<CallInfo>.duration`` attribute, created using ``time.perf_counter()``. This attribute is used to fill the ``<TestReport>.duration``, which is more accurate than ``<CallInfo>.stop - <CallInfo>.start`` (as these are based on ``time.time()``). When ``time.perf_counter_ns`` is available (python >= 3.7) it is used instead of ``time.perf_counter`` to measure the duration. ``CallInfo`` and ``TestReport`` objects have an extra ``duration_ns`` attribute to store this highest-precision duration when available.
