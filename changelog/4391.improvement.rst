Improved precision of test durations measurement. ``CallInfo`` items now have a new ``<CallInfo>.duration`` attribute, created using ``time.perf_counter()``. This attribute is used to fill the ``<TestReport>.duration`` attribute, which is more accurate than the previous ``<CallInfo>.stop - <CallInfo>.start`` (as these are based on ``time.time()``).
