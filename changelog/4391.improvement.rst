Improved time counter used to compute test durations. ``<CallInfo>.start`` is now retro-computed as ``<CallInfo>.stop - duration``, where ``duration`` is counted using ``time.perf_counter()``. When `time.perf_counter_ns` is available (python >= 3.7) it is used instead of ``time.perf_counter`` to measure execution time. ``CallInfo`` and ``TestReport`` objects have an extra ``duration_ns`` attribute to store this highest-precision duration when available.
