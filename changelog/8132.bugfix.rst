Fixed regression in ``approx``: in 6.2.0 ``approx`` no longer raises
``TypeError`` when dealing with non-numeric types, falling back to normal comparison.
Before 6.2.0, array types like tf.DeviceArray fell through to the scalar case,
and happened to compare correctly to a scalar if they had only one element.
After 6.2.0, these types began failing, because they inherited neither from
standard Python number hierarchy nor from ``numpy.ndarray``.

``approx`` now converts arguments to ``numpy.ndarray`` if they expose the array
protocol and are not scalars. This treats array-like objects like numpy arrays,
regardless of size.
