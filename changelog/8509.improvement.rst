Fixed issue where `TestCase.setUpClass` is not called when a test method has `/` in its name in versions of `pytest >=6.2.0`.

Paths only consider `/` parts of a patch until the first `::` in `iterparentnodeids`. Then `::` parts of a path are considered. Test cases for this were updated to reflect this change.
