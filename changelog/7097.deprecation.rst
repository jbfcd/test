The ``pytest._fillfuncargs`` function is now deprecated. This function was kept
for backward compatibility with an older plugin.

It's functionality is not meant to be used directly, but if you must replace
it, use `function._request._fillfixtures()` instead, though note this is not
a public API and may break in the future.
